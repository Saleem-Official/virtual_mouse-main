# virtual_mouse-main
A Python-based project that uses a webcam and hand gesture recognition to control the mouse cursor. It leverages OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for hand landmark detection, and PyAutoGUI for mouse control, allowing users to move the cursor with their index finger and click by pinching their thumb and index finger together.
